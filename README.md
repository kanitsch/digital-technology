# Digital Technology

This repository contains lab assignments and an additional FPGA project developed for the **Digital Technology** course at AGH UST.

## Repository Content

* **FPGA Project**: A VHDL implementation of a menu selector: 
    * **Value Selection**: Left button increments the value on the left 7-segment display.
    * **Value Transfer**: Right button copies the current value from the left display to the right display.
    * **Enhanced Functionality**: A custom animation sequence triggered when both buttons are pressed simultaneously.
* **Multisim Files**: Circuit designs and simulations for Lab Exercises 1–3.
* **Reports** for Lab Exercises 1–4 (PDF).

## Technologies Used

* **VHDL**: Hardware description language for the FPGA logic.
* **Intel Quartus II**: Used for synthesis and FPGA implementation.
* **NI Multisim**: Used for logic circuit simulation and verification.
